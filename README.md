<p align="center">Building text editors has never had such flavor.</p>

<br>

**Caper** is a high-level framework for building custom rich text editors.

It takes inspiration from many projects, but focuses on simplicity and speed above all else.

And of course, it also packs a punch on its own:

- **Minimal Object Model** which can be extended
- **Operation-based state/edits** easily enabling advanced features
- **Modular and small** allowing anyone to easily learn the source code
